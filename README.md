# Minesweeper

This is a third attempt of mine at making a Minesweeper game. This time I want to try to create this classic by using Test-Driven Development and to see if it will lead me to a better design.
Initial configuration of Typescript, React and Jest was achieved with the help of the following tutorial: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter. Commands for starting the application, building and running the tests can also be found there.
